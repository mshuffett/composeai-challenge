## Some comments

I used nextJs for simplicity, 

If I had more time I would add some real tests, also probably do some more generic components and more reusable styles,
such as a "CommabdBarSection" styled with the 16px padding and the top borders. Also color and text can be improve a lot..
The `Tips` component was the last I built, could have spend more time building everything instead of adding all the test dependencies, since I just added 1 simple test
